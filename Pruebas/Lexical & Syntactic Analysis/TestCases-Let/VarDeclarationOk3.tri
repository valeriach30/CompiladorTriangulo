! Test of var declaration, it works
let
  var x: Integer;
  var j: Char;
  var k: Integer
in
  x := 1 * 3 + 2;
  putint (x); ! these commands are not part of let command
  putint (x+k);
  putint (x+j)

! Contextual Error: since putint() commands are not part of let command
! x, k and j are not part of their context (they are not declared in this context)
